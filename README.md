This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


Senior Design miniproject: Covid 19 Tracker App. Collaborators: zamorai, sharithg.

## Project Description.

The desktop application includes the following functionality:

* **Track deaths of the top countries in the world** (You can reuse the repo description you used earlier because this section doesn’t have to be long.)
* **Checklist of possible symptoms that indicate Covid-19 presence**
* **Table with information from Covid-19 API that lists the stats of every country in the world**
* **Admin page that tracks community symptoms**  

Simply log into the app using google auth or create your own account with email and password. The information is sent to our firebase and we log the information on the back-end. Once you log into the application, you can check the checkboxes that represent your symptoms you may be having and click the blue submit button on the bottom left corner. That will automatically send your symptoms to the database and update our admin page to reflect the changes. At the bottom of the app you can also input any country in the world (countries with spaces may be differend, like United States of America can be found by inputing united-states) to get today's new Covid cases and total cases and more.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

## Licensing.

This project used the full capacity of Firebase and it's authentication process, as well as serving as the backend to the project. We also used dependencies such as Axios for working with the API's, Material-UI for some of the design, create-react-app and its relevant scripts to work and bootstrap the project, as well as jest to run some tests. The routing of the website was done using React Router DOM.
